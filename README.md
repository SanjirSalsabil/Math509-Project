Modelling the Movement of Salmonellain Gastrointestinal Mucus

In this project, the movement of Salmonella bacteria in fresh, undiluted gastrointestinal mucus frommice will be examined.
This will be accomplished by examining 993 readings of different bacteriaparticle movements from the previous study done bySchroeder et al.

These readings are from twenty seven different videos where the movement of individual Salmonella bacterium were tracked, with their x and y coordinates measured in pixel coordinates of dx= 0.156 Î¼m 
and the time measured in frames of dt= 0.0667seconds.
